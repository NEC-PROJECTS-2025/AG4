    <p>
        The <strong>Medical Dataset Analysis Project</strong> is designed to provide efficient and accurate tools 
        for analyzing complex medical datasets. By combining advanced optimization algorithms with robust 
        classification techniques, the system empowers healthcare professionals and researchers to make 
        data-driven decisions.
    </p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>
            Medical datasets often consist of a large number of features, many of which are irrelevant, 
            redundant, or noisy. This project addresses these challenges by implementing a novel feature 
            selection method called <strong>BGEO-TVFL</strong> (Binary Golden Eagle Optimization with Time-Varying 
            Flight Length), paired with the <strong>K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)</strong> classifier for accurate 
            data classification.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul class="features-list">
            <li>Efficient feature selection using <strong>BGEO-TVFL</strong>.</li>
            <li>Accurate classification with <strong>KNN</strong> for medical datasets.</li>
